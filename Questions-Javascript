1. What are the different data types present in javascript?
To know the type of a JavaScript variable, we can use the typeof operator.

1. Primitive types

String - It represents a series of characters and is written with quotes. A string can be represented using a single or a double quote.

Example :

var str = "Vivek Singh Bisht"; //using double quotes
var str2 = 'John Doe'; //using single quotes
Number - It represents a number and can be written with or without decimals.
Example :

var x = 3; //without decimal
var y = 3.6; //with decimal
BigInt - This data type is used to store numbers which are above the limitation of the Number data type. It can store large integers and is represented by adding “n” to an integer literal.
Example :

var bigInteger =  234567890123456789012345678901234567890;
Boolean - It represents a logical entity and can have only two values : true or false. Booleans are generally used for conditional testing.
Example :

var a = 2;
var b =  3;
var c =  2;
(a == b) // returns false
(a == c) //returns true
Undefined - When a variable is declared but not assigned, it has the value of undefined and it’s type is also undefined.
Example :

var x; // value of x is undefined
var y = undefined; // we can also set the value of a variable as undefined
Null - It represents a non-existent or a invalid value.
Example :

var z = null;
Symbol - It is a new data type introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. It is used to store an anonymous and unique value.
Example :

var symbol1 = Symbol('symbol');
typeof of primitive types :
typeof "John Doe" // Returns "string"
typeof 3.14 // Returns "number"
typeof true // Returns "boolean"
typeof 234567890123456789012345678901234567890n // Returns bigint
typeof undefined // Returns "undefined"
typeof null // Returns "object" (kind of a bug in JavaScript)
typeof Symbol('symbol') // Returns Symbol
2. Non-primitive types

Primitive data types can store only a single value. To store multiple and complex values, non-primitive data types are used.
Object - Used to store collection of data.
Example:
// Collection of data in key-value pairs

var obj1 = {
   x:  43,
   y:  "Hello world!",
   z: function(){
      return this.x;
   }
}
      
// Collection of data as an ordered list
     
var array1 = [5, "Hello", true, 4.1]; 
Note- It is important to remember that any data type that is not a primitive data type, is of Object type in javascript.


2. Explain Hoisting in javascript.
Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.

This means that irrespective of where the variables and functions are declared, they are moved on top of the scope. The scope can be both local and global.

Example 1:

hoistedVariable = 3;
console.log(hoistedVariable); // outputs 3 even when the variable is declared after it is initialized	
var hoistedVariable;
Example 2:

hoistedFunction();  // Outputs " Hello world! " even when the function is declared after calling

function hoistedFunction(){ 
  console.log(" Hello world! ");
} 
Example 3:

// Hoisting takes place in the local scope as well
function doSomething(){
  x = 33;
  console.log(x);
  var x;
} 
doSomething(); // Outputs 33 since the local variable “x” is hoisted inside the local scope

Note - Variable initializations are not hoisted, only variable declarations are hoisted:
var x;
console.log(x); // Outputs "undefined" since the initialization of "x" is not hoisted
x = 23;
Note - To avoid hoisting, you can run javascript in strict mode by using “use strict” on top of the code:
"use strict";
x = 23; // Gives an error since 'x' is not declared
var x; 


3. Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript?
The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code. Built-in debuggers may be switched on and off, requiring the user to report faults. The remaining section of the code should stop execution before moving on to the next line while debugging.


4. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both values and types.

Example:

var x = 2;
var y = "2";
(x == y)  // Returns true since the value of both x and y is the same
(x === y) // Returns false since the typeof x is "number" and typeof y is "string"


5. Difference between var and let keyword in javascript.
Some differences are 

From the very beginning, the 'var' keyword was used in JavaScript programming whereas the keyword 'let' was just added in 2015.
The keyword 'Var' has a function scope. Anywhere in the function, the variable specified using var is accessible but in ‘let’ the scope of a variable declared with the 'let' keyword is limited to the block in which it is declared. Let's start with a Block Scope.
In ECMAScript 2015, let and const are hoisted but not initialized. Referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError because the variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed.
